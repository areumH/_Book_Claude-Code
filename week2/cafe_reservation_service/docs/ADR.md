## ADR-001: Frontend Framework Selection

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-01  

### Context
Need to select a frontend framework for building a modern, responsive cafe reservation system with complex state management requirements and real-time features.

### Decision
Use React 18 with TypeScript, Vite build tool, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Rationale

- **TypeScript**: Type safety reduces bugs, better developer experience, easier refactoring
- **Vite**: Fast development server, optimized production builds, excellent TypeScript integration
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first approach, consistent design system, smaller bundle size

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Vue.js 3**: Good TypeScript support but smaller ecosystem
2. **Angular**: Full framework but higher complexity for this use case
3. **Svelte**: Great performance but less mature ecosystem
4. **Next.js**: Overkill for SPA requirements, unnecessary SSR complexity

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Fast development with hot reloading
- Strong type safety across the application
- Large community and extensive documentation
- Easy integration with state management solutions

**Negative:**
- Larger initial bundle size compared to some alternatives

## ADR-002: State Management Solution

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-01  

### Context
The application requires global state management for user authentication, cafe data, reservation state, and UI state across multiple components.

### Decision
Use Zustand for state management with localStorage persistence for authentication.

### Rationale
- **Minimal boilerplate**: Less code compared to Redux
- **TypeScript-first**: Excellent TypeScript integration
- **Flexible**: Works with both class and functional components
- **Performance**: Built-in selectors prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Small bundle size**: ~2.5KB vs Redux ~15KB+

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Redux Toolkit**: Industry standard but more boilerplate
2. **Context API**: Built-in but can cause performance issues with frequent updates
3. **Recoil**: Facebook's solution but still experimental
4. **Jotai**: Atomic approach but added complexity

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Clean, readable state management code
- Easy to test and debug
- Good performance characteristics
- Minimal learning curve

**Negative:**
- Smaller community compared to Redux
- Fewer devtools and debugging options
- Less extensive middleware ecosystem

## ADR-003: Backend Framework Selection

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-01  

### Context
Need a backend framework for REST API development with authentication, file handling, and potential real-time features.

### Decision
Use Node.js with Express.js, TypeScript, and JWT authentication.

### Rationale
- **Node.js**: JavaScript/TypeScript consistency across stack
- **Express.js**: Mature, flexible, extensive middleware ecosystem
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **JWT**: Stateless authentication, suitable for distributed systems

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Nest.js**: More opinionated but added complexity
2. **Fastify**: Better performance but smaller ecosystem
3. **Python (Django/FastAPI)**: Different language breaks stack consistency
4. **Go (Gin/Echo)**: Performance benefits but different language

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Shared language and types between frontend/backend
- Large ecosystem of npm packages
- Easy deployment and scaling options
- Familiar to most JavaScript developers

**Negative:**
- Single-threaded nature may not suit CPU-intensive tasks
- Runtime type checking needed for API validation

## ADR-004: Database Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-01  

### Context
Need to decide on data persistence strategy for development and production phases.

### Decision
Use mock data (in-memory) for development, PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for production.

### Rationale
- **Mock Data Phase**: Faster development, no database setup required, predictable test data
- **PostgreSQL**: ACID compliance, excellent JSON support, mature ecosystem
- **Prisma**: Type-safe database access, excellent TypeScript integration, migration system

### Alternatives Considered
1. **MongoDB**: NoSQL flexibility but less structured data
2. **MySQL**: Familiar but less advanced JSON support
3. **SQLite**: Simple but not suitable for production scaling
4. **Firebase**: Managed solution but vendor lock-in

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Rapid development start with mock data
- Type safety with Prisma
- Scalable production database
- Easy migration path from mock to real data

**Negative:**
- Need to maintain both mock and real schemas
- Two different data access patterns during development

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-01  

### Context
Need secure authentication system supporting multiple user roles (USER, CAFE_OWNER, ADMIN) with session management.

### Decision
Implement JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing and role-based access control.

### Rationale
- **JWT**: Stateless, scalable, works well with SPAs
- **bcrypt**: Industry standard for password hashing
- **Role-based**: Flexible permission system for different user types

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Session-based auth**: Requires server-side storage, not stateless
2. **OAuth2**: Overkill for internal authentication
3. **Auth0**: Third-party dependency and cost
4. **Firebase Auth**: Vendor lock-in

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Stateless scaling capability
- Clear security model
- Flexible role system
- No external dependencies

**Negative:**
- Token management complexity
- Logout requires client-side token deletion
- Token refresh not implemented initially

- **shadcn/ui**: High-quality React components, customizable, TypeScript support
- **Combination**: Best of both worlds - utility flexibility with pre-built components

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Material-UI (MUI)**: Complete but heavyweight and opinionated
2. **Ant Design**: Good components but specific design language
3. **Styled Components**: CSS-in-JS but performance concerns
4. **CSS Modules**: Modular but more manual work

### Consequences

### Decision
Use React Hook Form with Zod validation schemas.

### Rationale
- **React Hook Form**: Excellent performance, minimal re-renders, good TypeScript support
- **Zod**: Type-safe validation, generates TypeScript types, runtime validation
- **Integration**: Works well together for end-to-end type safety

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Formik**: Popular but more re-renders and larger bundle
2. **React Final Form**: Good but less TypeScript integration
3. **Native form handling**: Too much boilerplate for complex forms
4. **Yup validation**: Less type safety compared to Zod

### Consequences
**Positive:**

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-01  

### Context
Need consistent API design for frontend-backend communication with proper error handling and data structure.

### Decision
Implement RESTful API with standardized response format and status codes.

### Rationale
- **REST**: Well-understood pattern, cacheable, stateless
- **Standardized responses**: Consistent error handling, easier frontend development
- **HTTP status codes**: Standard semantics for different scenarios

### Response Format:
```typescript
// Success
{
  success: true,
  data: T,
  message?: string,
  meta?: PaginationInfo
}

// Error
{
  success: false,
  error: {
    code: string,
    message: string,
    details?: any
  }
}
```

### Alternatives Considered
1. **GraphQL**: Overkill for current requirements, added complexity
2. **tRPC**: TypeScript-first but requires specific setup
3. **Custom response formats**: Inconsistent, harder to maintain

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Consistent error handling across application
- Easy to extend and maintain
- Clear API contracts
- Standard HTTP semantics

**Negative:**
- Some redundancy in response structure
- Need to maintain response type definitions
- Over-fetching data in some cases

### Decision
Use multer middleware for file handling with local filesystem storage for development, cloud storage for production.

### Rationale
- **multer**: Standard Express.js file handling middleware
- **Local storage**: Simple development setup
- **Cloud storage**: Scalable production solution (AWS S3, etc.)

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Express built-in**: Too basic for file validation
2. **Formidable**: Alternative but multer more popular
3. **Direct cloud upload**: Complex client-side implementation
4. **Base64 encoding**: Poor performance for images
